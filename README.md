## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project was to showcase my programming and game development skills through the creation of an engaging platformer game. It serves as a testament to my ability to design and implement game mechanics, user interface, and engaging content. The choice of sprites, inspired by "Among Us" and Minecraft, was driven by a desire to pay tribute to these iconic games and their influence on the gaming community, not to claim their original artwork as my own.

## Disclaimer

The character and door sprites used in this game are artistic interpretations inspired by Among Us and Minecraft, respectively, and are not official assets from these games. The use of these inspired sprites is intended for a non-commercial, educational project designed to showcase programming skills and creativity.
